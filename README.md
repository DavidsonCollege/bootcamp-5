# bootcamp-5

I'm out of town today. Your task is to complete [this react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). It is a _very_ good start to the world of React. Don't worry about grasping everything. Just try to understand the basics, and we'll dive in head first on Monday. 

Wrapping your head around all of this should take you the entire day. If you finish with the first tutorial, move on to [other ones](https://tylermcginnis.com/reactjs-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide-to-building-apps-with-react/). There are hundreds out there. 

Good luck and happy weekend! I'll be on off of Slack throughout the day as my connection allows.
