# bootcamp-5

## Release 1
Your task is to complete [this react tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html). It is a _very_ good start to the world of React. Don't worry about grasping everything. Just try to understand the basics.

## Release 2 
Now that you've gotten a little familiarity with React, use `create-react-app` to make a very basic todolist. The application should do the following: 

* Allow a user to add and remove todos.
* Allow user to mark a todo as a complete/incomplete.
* When a todo is marked as complete, it should move to a completed section. If a completed todo is marked as incomplete, the todo should move back to the main list. 
* Allow user to set due dates. 
* Allow user to reorder todos alphabetically or by due date. 
* Allow user to clear all todos. 

Do this is a branch called `[usernames]-todo1`. 

Note: You should write this excercise exlusively on the front end. Do not try to connect to a server.
